This project contains some examples of compile-time techniques in Java, as presented to the Melbourne Scala User Group on 28/3/2011.  

It contains implementations of:
- The Builder pattern, with normal runtime error checking
- The Builder pattern with compile-time error-checking, with only some minor tweaks to the runtime version.
- The Smart Constructor pattern as demonstrated by Tony Morris in the Scala-Debate mailing list.
- My attempt at Tony Morris' compile-time TicTacToe challenge.
